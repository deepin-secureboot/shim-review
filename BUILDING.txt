To reproduce the build in a container defined by the attached Dockerfile, run:

```
./build.sh
```

This will print the SHA256 checksum of the shimx64.efi binary that was just
built, as well as copy the file to the current directory and verify its
checksum against the attached shimx64.efi.sha256sum at the end of the process.
